1. Finish implementing the save and cancel button. When save is clicked, replace the original with the updated car and change the edit row to view row. When cancel is clicked, discard the changes, and chance the edit row to view row.

2. If a car row is being edited and either 'Add Car' or 'Delete Car' are clicked, discard the edit row changes and change the edit row back to view row. Do complete the 'Add Car' or 'Delete Car' operation.

3. Ensure it works.
