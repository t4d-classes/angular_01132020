Exercise 15

1. Upgrade the append, replace and remove car operations to use a pipe instead of the nesting pattern.

2. If a REST API operation fails, handle the error, and display the error above the table.

Start your application in two terminal windows:

First Terminal: npm run web
Second Terminal: npm run REST

Loading the application in a web browser.

In the second terminal window, terminate the REST API with Ctrl-C

Then, try to add a car. It will fail, and a message should be displayed above the table.

3. Ensure it works.
